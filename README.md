Testing and Quality Assurance
Comprehensive automated testing was implemented to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the Mood Journal API backend.

Key Highlights:
Structured tests into unit, integration, and API categories for clear organization.

Used mongodb-memory-server for in-memory database testing to isolate tests from production data.

Mocked external dependencies such as the Spotify API to ensure deterministic and fast tests.

Achieved high test coverage:

üìà Statements: 93.61%

üß© Branches: 80.76%

‚öôÔ∏è Functions: 91.17%

üìÑ Lines: 93.47%

Improved error handling and input validation across all API endpoints.

Automated test coverage reports integrated into the development workflow.

How to Run Tests
bash
npm run test:coverage
This command runs all tests and generates a coverage report, helping maintain code quality as the project evolves.
